Exploring the Relationship Between Food Consumption Patterns and Diabetes Prevalence in South Africa A Provincial-Level Predictive Modeling Approach
1. INTRODUCTION
Diabetes mellitus is a growing public health concern in South Africa,
with increasing prevalence attributed torapid urbanisation, lifestyle
changes, and dietary transitions. The South African population is
experiencing anutrition shift from traditional diets to more processed
and calorie-dense foods, which may be contributing tothe rising
burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus (T2DM). Understandinghow food consumption patterns vary
by province and how these patterns are associated with diabetes
prevalence can provide critical insights for targeted health
interventions and public awareness campaigns.Despite the
availability of national surveys capturing health and dietary data,
relatively few studies have integrated these datasets to examine
provincial-level associations between dietary behaviours and
diabetes prevalence. Moreover, there is a lack of predictive tools that
can estimate diabetes risk across regions using food consumption
indicators and socio-demographic factors.This study aims to fill this
gap by integrating multiple datasets from national surveys and
administrative sources, and applying statistical and machine learning
techniques to build a predictive model of diabetes prevalence at the
provincial (and optionally district) level. The findings will guide
targeted regional awareness campaigns, resource allocation, and
prevention strategies.

predictive model that identifies regions at higher risk for diabetes,thereby supporting targeted public health interventions.

3. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
3.1. To collect and preprocess relevant datasets on foodconsumption, diabetes prevalence, and sociodemographic factors atthe provincial level in South Africa.
3.2. To quantify provincial food consumption/expenditure patterns bycategory (e.g., sugary beverages, refined carbohydrates, fruits &vegetables, fats/oils) and link them to diabetes prevalence.
3.3. To analyze the statistical association between food categoriesand diabetes prevalence while adjusting for key confounders (age,sex, obesity, physical inactivity, income, urbanisation).
3.4. To build and validate predictive models (e.g., GLM/betaregression, Random Forest/XGBoost, and spatial Bayesian CAR/BYMmodels) to estimate provincial diabetes risk.
3.5. To visualize spatial patterns and predicted risk zones usingchoropleth maps and risk scores.
3.6. To translate findings into actionable, province-specific awarenessand prevention strategies.
